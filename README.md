#  Hjerl Hede Museum (building module)

This module aims to recreate partially or entirely the Hjerl Hede outdoor museum from Denmark. It seemed a decent GCI 2017 idea as Cervator was going to Denmark anyway, thus able to take extra pictures :D

It is based heavily on [Structure Templates](https://github.com/Terasology/StructureTemplates)

## How to contribute

Check out the two following sources to learn about and see pictures from the museum:

* [Museum website](http://hjerlhede.dk)
* [Cervator's photo set](https://photos.app.goo.gl/BPAgJqN2B4GRy80B2)

Look around in the module as well as the issue tracker and pending PRs on GitHub for what work has been done and what's been completed

Pick a target building or other object you want to work on (maybe look for good images/info first) then submit an *issue* describing what you aim to design

When you are ready submit a PR with your added content. Be mindful of others possibly working on builds as well, thus the issues and PR checks :-)
